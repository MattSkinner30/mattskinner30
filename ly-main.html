<h1 class="secondary-title">The Lost Years</h1>
<p>The Lost Years started with The Advent. A massive, bright pink object descended from wildspace and impacted the planet. What accounts have survived describe it as a slow descension into the ocean, as opposed to an asteroid strike.</p>

<div class="three-column-container ">
	<div>
		<h2>0-3 Years<br><span style="color: #757575;">Post-Advent</span></h2>
		<p>The Northern Hemisphere reversed its rotation, causing it to spin in the opposite direction from the Southern Hemisphere. This phenomenon is still a mystery today, but it obviously changed the structure of our continents as they broke apart at the equator.</p>
		<p>This caused massive earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods, and destroyed much of the established world. Some city ruins became the basis for early settlements, but some were lost entirely.</p>
		<p>A seemingly magical substance matching the bright pink hue of the object from wildspace began appearing around the world, in the form of both crystals and liquid. It was quickly pieced together that this substance held great power, and it became centre-stage in the survival efforts. This substance became known as Nectar, a name that would end up being used for thousands of years.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>0-100 Years<br><span style="color: #757575;">Post-Advent</span></h2>
		<p>This period saw some of the surviving people form small groups and communities. Some include the Fellowship of the New World, the Confederation of the Old Tribes, and the Angels of the Rapture. Many of these groups formed because of their beliefs around Nectar.</p>
		<p>Because of the destruction and large-scale fires, much of the world was covered in ash for a century. Ash also clouded the sky the majority of the time, lowering the temperatures to winter-like colds. This was called the 100 Year Winter. This ash in turn helped provide great nutrients to the new wildlife of the world in the coming decades.</p>
		<p>The world underwent a period of rapid change. The Advent and itâ€™s power mutated the world and all life on it. Fierce monsters were born of mutated wildlife. The landscapes grew and twisted into hyperbolized versions of themselves. Many people simply died, as they could not survive the mutations and disease spreading around the world.</p>
		<p>It is estimated that only about 5% of the population on Galowa survived into the first generation Post-Advent.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>0-500 Years<br><span style="color: #757575;">Post-Advent</span></h2>
		<p>A massive amount of rapid evolution and mutation took place in the first 500 years. New races and species, new wildlife, new lands. Many of which had grown from the nature already on Bern, but mutated and enhanced with the power of The Advent.</p>
		<p>During this time people also gained unexplained powers. We now know this to be called magic, but at the time it was new, and uncontrolled. Many people succumbed to their own magic, as it was simply too powerful for their bodies to harness.</p>

	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>500-3,500 Years<br><span style="color: #757575;">Post-Advent</span></h2>
		<p>For much of this period there is little recorded history. It is suspected that during this time, evolution went to work. Natural selection determined what new races and species could survive on this planet. This was a slow process, obviously. </p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>3,500-4,500 Years<br><span style="color: #757575;">Post-Advent</span></h2>
		<p>This period started to see the return of people keeping historical records, and the early stages of civilization. The largest cities were small settlements at this time, but things were starting to stabilise.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>4,000-5,000 Years<br><span style="color: #757575;">Post-Advent</span></h2>
		<p>People here learned to harness the power of the Nectar Crystals. They would power vehicles, tools, and the massive engines used to keep flying cities in the air. Civilization reached heights never before thought possible.</p>
