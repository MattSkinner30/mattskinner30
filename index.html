<h1 class="main-title">Welcome to Bern</h1>
<p>Many call the Realm of Bern home; from heroes to villains to farmers, its population is as diverse as its history is rich. However, Bern will look quite different depending on when you visit her. The Realm’s history can be divided up roughly into three periods. The Before Times, The Lost Years, and The Second Age.</p>

<p>Each of these periods have their own full history, but can be roughly categorised as the following:</p>

<div class="three-column-container ">
	<div>
		<h2>The Before Times<br><span style="color: #757575;">~ 3,800 years</h2>
		<p>The Before Times refer to all years between the invention of the creation of the Universal Calendar and The Advent. Civilizations were mighty, but simple. Technology never advanced past the early stages of manned aircraft, and much of the world’s systems were mediaeval in nature.</p>
		<a class="button-link" href="bt-main.html">Enter the Before Times</a>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>The Lost Years<br><span style="color: #757575;">~ 5,000 years</span></h2>
		<p>The Advent brought apocalyptic destruction to the world of Bern. Its people were killed, and its landscape was changed. Only a very small percentage of the population survived. These were the lost years, a period of destruction and rebirth that lasted about 5,000 years.</p>
		<a class="button-link" href="bt-main.html">Enter the Lost Years</a>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>The Second Age<br><span style="color: #757575;">Ongoing</h2>
		<p>New resources from The Advent gave Bern the ability to reach new heights, meringue magic and technology to accomplish great things. Taking inspiration from what little they could gather from the Before Times, they decided to renew the Universal Calendar, starting fresh at year zero.</p>

<h2>Calendar & Dates</h2>
<p>A year on Bern consists of 400 days, divided into four seasons of 100 days each. The four seasons are commonly referred to by the following names<p>
<p class="bold">Latha > Celea > Ista > Elda</p>
<p>These are named after the four gods of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Some people will refer to the months by different names - names based on the four gods of defilement. This is not common and is mostly used within the safety of specific religions. In this instance, the four seasons are referred to by the following names:</p>
<p class="bold">Shad > Seld > Keled > Lovad</p>
<p>The seasons in Bern are fairly stable from a weather standpoint. The realm is warmest in Celea (Seld) and coldest in Elda (Lovad), although it only differs by a few degrees. This can be enough to impact the planting/harvesting cycle for some more sensitive crops but generally is not enough to warrant any sort of adaptation between seasons.</p>
<p>They do not use weeks as a measurement of time in Bern. Simply the season and the day. An example of a date you might see it:</p>
<p class="bold">Latha 28th, 3,722</p>
<p>Which can also be expressed as:</p>
<p class="bold">28-1-3722</p>
<p>A day contains 24 hours and each hour contains 60 minutes. Yes, this is the same as real life. Why make it complicated for no reason?
People will often devise their schedules based on numerical patterns. This makes it easier to remember. For example, someone who works every other day might say they work on odds. This means they would work on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.</p>
<p>Someone might say they visit their church on fives. This means they would go on the 5th, 15th, 25th, etc. A typical schedule for a working individual would be to work six out of every ten days.</p>

		<p>The Before Times refer to all years between the invention of the creation of the Universal Calendar and The Advent. Civilizations were mighty, but simple. Technology never advanced past the early stages of manned aircraft, and much of the world’s systems were mediaeval in nature.</p>

		<h2>The Celestial Realm<br><span style="color: #757575;">Good</span></h2>

	<div>
		<h2>The Abyssal Realm<br><span style="color: #757575;">Evil</h2>
		<p>New resources from The Advent gave Bern the ability to reach new heights, meringue magic and technology to accomplish great things. Taking inspiration from what little they could gather from the Before Times, they decided to renew the Universal Calendar, starting fresh at year zero.</p>

	<div>
		<h2>The Prime Plane<br><span style="color: #757575;">"Normal"</h2>
		<p>The Prime Plane is the original plane of the Balanced Realm. It houses the land of Bern, offers a generally temperate climate, linear time, and gives beings the chance to live normal, safe lives… <br><br>...usually.</p>

	<div>
		<h2>The Feywild<br><span style="color: #757575;">Wild & Funky</span></h2>
		<p>The Feywild is a land of mystery and wonder mainly inhabited by Fey creatures. Wild Magic originates from the Feywilds. Although somewhat of a reflection of the Prime Plane, the Feywilds sometimes waver and change in unpredictable ways.</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Plane of Shadows<br><span style="color: #757575;">Dark & Spooky</h2>
		<p>A lightless reflection of the Prime Plane, this place is largely inhabited by evil beings and fierce monstrosities. The Plane of Shadows is known for its abundance of death and decay. Very few travel to and from the Plane of Shadows.</p>
