<h1>Bern</h1>
<p>Many call the Realm of Bern home; from heroes to villains to farmers, its population is as diverse as its history is rich. However, Bern will look quite different depending on when you visit her. The Realm’s history can be divided up roughly into three periods. The Before Times, The Lost Years, and The Second Age.</p>

<p>Each of these periods have their own full history, but can be roughly categorised as the following:</p>

<h2>The Before Times | ~ 3,800 years</h2>
<p>The Before Times refer to all year between the invention of the creation of the Universal Calendar and The Advent. Civilizations were mighty, but simple. Technology never advanced past the early stages of manned aircraft, and much of the world’s systems were mediaeval in nature. There is little known about the early civilizations before this time, and it is generally referred to as Pre-History.</p>

<h2>The Lost Years | ~ 5,000 years</h2>

<p>From the day of The Advent to the formation of the World Council. This is a period estimated to be about 5,000 years. The Advent brought apocalyptic destruction to the world of Bern. Its people were killed, and its landscape was changed. Only a very small percentage of the population survived. But The Advent also brought with it a blessing. It brough Nectar to the world. Nectar - a mysterious but very powerful substance - would eventually lead to technological breakthroughs never imagined in The Before TImes. </p>
<h2>The Second Age | Ongoing</h2>
<p>Technology and magic work together to create unbelievable feats. Flying cities and airships are but two examples of the new world.  The Second Age began with the creation of the World Council. Taking inspiration from what little they could gather from the Before Times, they decided to renew the Universal Calendar, starting fresh at year zero.</p>
