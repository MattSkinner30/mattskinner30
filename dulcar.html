<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Dulcar is the oldest - and largest - kingdom in Bern. The landscape consists of grassy hills, forests, plains, and small mountain ranges. While home to a couple of larger cities - including the largest in the realm: Floraport - they are vastly outnumbered by the smaller towns spread around Dulcar’s large area.</p>
<p>The area that Dulcar encompasses was once two kingdoms; Dulcar in the north and Legallon in the south.</p>
<p>The kingdom most recently took part in a war with Mezzogonia.</p>

<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>Dulcar is a monarchy, ruled by the Grand Duke or Grand Duchess. At the time of writing, the kingdom is ruled by Grand Duchess Priscilla. When describing the term generally or in a gender-neutral context, the term Grand Leader can be use</p>
<p>The Grand Leader resides in the capital city of Floraport, under the watch of the Grand Protection Force.</p>
<h3>Environment and Climate</h3>
<p>Dulcar has a very neutral climate. Warmer summer-like weather keeps the majority of the kingdom farmable all year round. Only the more southern regions fall into slightly more autumn-adjacent weather because they receive slightly less sunlight.</p>
<p>There are a nice variety of forests, mountains, flatlands, and coasts, but none are as extreme examples as in other kingdoms.</p>
<h3>Economy</h3>
<p>Dulcar’s economy is just like the Kingdom - large and widespread. Given how much territory they have access to, they are able to participate in many different industries. They are able to participate in every step of a product's lifecycle, from resource gathering to crafting to selling. Only exotic materials require looking out to other kingdoms.</p>
<p>Floraport is also an economic powerhouse, hosting the largest market in Bern and more skilled labourers and specialists than any other city. If you need something, you will likely be able to find it in Floraport.</p>
<p>Farming is one of the largest industries. Dulcar produces over half of all food produced in Bern.</p>
<h2>Cities & Areas</h2>
<h3>Floraport</h3>
<p>The largest city in Dulcar, as well as all of Bern. Located on the Northern coast of Dulcar, it has access to sea and land routes for trade. It's home to a very expansive shopping district.</p>
<p>On the surface, Floraport may appear as a bustling city filled with lively citizens, but there is an ever struggle of income inequality between the different districts of the city.</p>
<p>Although the ruler of Dulcar is housed in Floraport, they are not the one who rules over the city. This falls to the city council. The council is made up of one member of each district in the city (High Town, Lower Town, Merchant's District, The Array). These are elected by the people of that district. Each one is elected for one term - three years.</p>
<p>Many of the smaller towns in the northern regions of Dulcar will send merchants to sell their products in Floraport. This is how the city gets the vast majority of its food and raw materials. The city is full of all kinds of craftsmen and tradespeople who turn these materials into goods to sell at the markets.</p>
<p>Floraport has lowered trade tariffs at their docks to almost zero, in an effort to persuade other kingdoms to trade directly with them as opposed to going through Struaq’ Prya. The routes from the north and south of Dulcar are much longer, but the lack of fees is enough to persuade some people.</p>
<h3>Legallon</h3>
<p>Legallon is the second largest city in Dulcar. Located on the Triage of Lakes and just off the Hardunius Highway, it acts as a hub for the towns in the Southern part of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Legallon was once a kingdom of its own, with this city as its capital.</p>
<h3>Lemonsville</h3>
<p>This spot was discovered in 1990 by orc pioneers who grew lemon trees and pooped themselves frequently enough that it was a problem. Currently, still a majority of the population is Orcish. Their defecation issue has since been resolved, as they have acquired a tolerance for the acidity of lemons, which initially shocked their system.</p>
<p>These Orcs really fucking love lemons. They use lemon in almost every aspect of their lives. Not only do they cook with it, but they use it as skincare, clothing, armour, and as a religious symbol. The coast is lined with vivid yellow lemon trees all year round.</p>
<h3>Urax</h3>
<p>A smaller orcish settlement on the Southern coast. They mainly operate in the fishing industry, supplying fish to many of the southern locations in Dulcar. Despite being a coastal town, they are not near any major transportation routes, so their port doesn’t see much traffic.</p>
<h3>Knightscross</h3>
<p>A large town located at the crossroads of trade routes between Northern Dulcar, Southern Dulcar, and Struaq-Prya.
Mainly designed to satisfy the needs or travellers and trades people coming through.</p>
