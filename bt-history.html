			<h2>2151 | War of the Nomads</h2>
			<p>Although the area had previously been considered too mountainous and left alone, Dulcar had began contemplating bringing the area into their kingdoms' borders. They thought it could potentially pay off long-term should they ever find themselves in a conflict with Mezzogonia.<br><br>The various tribes and nomads who lived there immediately objected. They spoke with Mezzogonia who advised them to become an officially recognized kingdom, then Dulcar could not absorb them without officially declaring war (something that would not want to do after just finishing one a couple of years prior).<br><br>The tribes took this advice to heart and began working on a system of governance that they could present to the other kingdoms. The only issue was that each tribe thought they should be in charge. This rapidly devolved into civil war between the different tribes.
			After some consolidation, five primary tribes fought for leadership of modern day Rutaiji. Some fought with brutal, eccentric fighting styles like the Fald. Some fought with range and tact, like the Sorth.<br><br>The Rut clan was one that lacked strength in battle but made up with smarts and diplomacy. They came upon a gold mine that hadn't yet been discovered by the neighbouring Mezzogonia. Realizing they couldn't win the war on their own, they secretly made a deal with Mezzogonia. The Rut would fund them (with the riches from their newfound gold mine) to quickly build an army in exchange for their help defeating the other nomadic tribes. As a good gesture and a sign of a long-lasting alliance, the Rut promised to give some land to Mezzogonia.<br><br>The Rut were victorious, and Rutaiji came to be.</p>

			<h2>2470 - 2473 | The War on the Dunes</h2>
			<p>With Struaq Prya establishing itself firmly along the West coast of Bern, the other countries realized they were quickly going to have almost full control over all the major trade routes in Bern. A temporary alliance was formed between Dulcar, Mezzogonia, and Rutaiji. This new alliance decided they would take over Struaq Prya and its all-encompassing trade routes.<br><br>They had almost every factor stacked in their favour, except for the one that would be their downfall: The Terrain. None of the soldiers from the mainland had any experience fighting in the desert. When Struaq Prya set up very tough choke points in the North and South, it forced the alliance to try and move in through the desert. It's not known how many actually survived this trek, but stories passed down in Struaq Prya tell of only a few men who made it. <br><br>With heavy casualties and no real progress to speak of, they decided to call off the attack. Increased tarriffs for the next 100 years made up any losses that came to Struaq Prya, and they still hold the trade routes to this very day.</p>

			<h2>2,894 | Ambermere and Icebound Desert Established</h2>
			<p>Although generally ungoverned, the rest of the kingdoms decided to treat the Icebound Desert and Ambermere as their own kingdoms. It had been determined that they were distinc enough, and no other kingdoms had an interest in trying to lay claim on them.<br><br>Ambermere is largely considered too dangerous to live in, and the Icebound Desert is too far and cold to be worth the investment.<br><br>Unlike Ambermere, the Icebound Desert does have a decent population of different tribes and clans spread out across the kingdom.</p>

			<h2>3,428 | Mezzogonia Civil War</h2>
			<p>Growing tired of Mezzogonia’s lightweight standing in the world, a group called the Iron Claw chose to rebel against the kingdom. Their goal was to being Mezzogonia back to it’s previous glory. They gained enough support to almost rival the king’s forces. But, the Iron Claw’s troops were significantly better trained than the out-of-practice royal army.<br><br>After four months of skrimishes and gaining support, they officially declared themselves the new rulers of Mezzogonia and took the fight to the capital of Adonbridge. The war at this point was swift, ending only six weeks after it began.<br><br>The Icon Claw ruled the kingdom with the goal of establishing a significant role in Bern, and earning the respect they deserved from the other kingdoms.<br><br></p>

			<h2>3,722 - 3,726 | Mezzogonia Dulcar War</h2>
			<p>The seeds of this war began when Princess Priscilla - daughter of Grand Duke Athelard - was kidnapped. Although it was unknown at the time who took her, he still spun into a depression. He let his duties slip as he became emotionally unstable.<br><br>This lack of leadership from the Grand Duke sent economic and political waves through the kingdom. This resulted in the start of an economic and social collapse.<br><br>Seeing this, King Hawkin Soulsteel - ruler of Mezzogonia - announced a war. He would March into Dulcar, dethrone the Grand Duke, and run Dulcar as it was meant to be.<br><br>He also announced he would welcome any civilians under his rule, and would not attack any during his advances. Many civilians were on board with this. Many were not.<br><br>He slowly advanced across Dulcar before meeting the Dulcarian army outside Knightscross. They clashed, and slowly Dulcar was pushed all the way back to its capital - Floraport. A bloody battle ensued.<br><br>Although the specifics are still not documented, Grand Duke Athelard was killed during the Battle of Floraport. Mezzogonia occupied the capital for a time</p>
