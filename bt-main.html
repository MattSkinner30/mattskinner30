<h1 class="main-title">The Before Times</h1>
<p>For entire civilizations, the Before Times were simply just, life. Although it can perhaps be easy to assume that an age dubbed the Before Times to be simple and medieval, that would be a mistake - a reductive assumption that many in the modern day make.</p>
<p>The Before Times was a collection of societies that were smaller, generally speaking. The land was mostly one large continent, and their weather mostly temperate.</p>
<p>Although by modern standards their technology was quite simple, at the height of their civilization they had created Warforged, manned aircraft, and their work with arc crystals was impressive for the time.</p>
<p>The Before Times are broken down into the following three periods:</p>

<div class="three-column-container ">
	<div>
		<h2>Foundation Period<br><span style="color: #757575;">0 - 1,758</h2>
		<p>The Foundation Period are the early stages of the Before Times. These are the centuries when the kingdoms established themselves, and the world of Bern was explored. This period begins when the kingdom of Dulcar was established, and began the Universal Calendar.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Abasement Period<br><span style="color: #757575;">1,758 - 2,731</span></h2>
		<p>Having many of the kingdoms of Bern estblished and little of the land left unclaimed, the societies of decided to turn on each other in an effort to grow their borders. This period saw the Dulcar Legallon War, the War of the Nomads, and the War on the Dunes.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Stability Period<br><span style="color: #757575;">2,731 - 3,740</h2>
		<p>By this point the superpowers of the lands had been established. Everyone, more or less, knew their place in the world. These times were relatively peaceful, and saw an increase in technology and quality of life for the citizens of Bern.</p>
